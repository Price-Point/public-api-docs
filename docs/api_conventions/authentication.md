# Authentication
The PricePoint API uses API keys to authenticate requests. To request an API key please contact PricePoint at [hello@pricepointmoves.com](mailto:hello@pricepointmoves.com). APIs can be accessed via the endpoint [https://pricepoint.pricepointmoves.com](https://pricepoint.pricepointmoves.com). All requests to the PricePoint API must be made over HTTPS. All requests must be authenticated by supplying the `x-api-key` header with a valid API key.
